== Welcome to My Starter Project

i've found that for most all webapp like projects, i need some things that
rails doesn't give me out of the box.  so i created this project as a starting
off point for my webapp projects.  it contains some basic css, a basic user
model with authentication (using authlogic) as well as the routing and views to
make login/logout work.

== Getting Started

1. clone this repo
2. copy all the files into a new directory
  a. cd /projects/starter-project
  b. cp -r * ../your-spiff-new-project
3. develop away on your-spiff-new-project
